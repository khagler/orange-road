# Orange Road Website #

This is the [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/) source for my personal website, [orange-road.com](http://www.orange-road.com/). I'd been maintaining this site using a Windows product called CityDesk, but it had been abandoned years ago so I thought it best to try moving it to something a bit more modern. This is also an opportunity to do something practical with Ruby.

## Requirements

* image_size

	Used to generate the width and height attributes for `img` tags. To install, `gem install image_size`.
