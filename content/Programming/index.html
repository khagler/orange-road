title: Programming Stuff

<p>I have several projects on <a href="https://github.com/khagler" title="My GitHub Profile">GitHub</a>:</p>

<%= github_public_repos("khagler") %>

<p>I also have an account on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/khagler" title="My Bitbucket Profile">Bitbucket</a>, although so far there are no public projects there. There's also a very old <a href="/frontier/" title="My Frontier Stuff">section</a> of this site dedicated to <a href="http://frontierkernel.org/">Userland Frontier</a>, although I haven't actually done anything with Frontier in over fifteen years.</p>

<p>Most of my programming work is done for Symantec, but I can't show any of it (or even talk about it in much detail). The most noteworthy project I work on there is a <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> build system I call the Build Class, because for a long time it was a single rather large Python class. I recently finished putting it through a major overhaul, as large portions of it were written ten years ago when I was just learning Python.</p>

<p>In 2012 I noticed that when searching the web for the solution to a programming-related problem, the answer quite often appeared on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>. I spent some time looking over the site, and now spend a fair amount of time there:<br />
