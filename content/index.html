title: What does the name mean?
---

<p>Orange Road is a reference to one of my favorite stories, <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimagure_Orange_Road">Kimagure Orange Road</a></cite>. <dfn>Kimagure</dfn> means “capricious” or “whimsical” in Japanese, and Orange Road is the name of a (fictional) street in Tokyo where the central character lives.</p>

<p>You won’t find much in the way of <cite>Kimagure Orange Road</cite> stuff here, in part because I don’t want to invite legal trouble, but mostly because plenty of other people have already done a much better job than I could.</p>
