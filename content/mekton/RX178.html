<h2>Roleplaying Notes</h2>
<p>This design was done using the <a href="gundamRules.html">guidelines</a> suggested by Benjamin Wright, and as such certain things won&rsquo;t add up as the normally would. In particular, maneuver pool and fuel weight are calculated a bit differently, and Mecha Reflex has a different meaning. </p>
<p>Performance information for this design was taken from the <a href="http://gundam.anime.net/">Gundam Project</a>. </p>
<p>Three Gundam Mk. II&rsquo;s were build by the Titans, but all were stolen within the first few days of the Gryps War. Only one of these was used during the war, with the other two being reserved for spare parts and research. The Gundam Mk. II was flown first by Camille Vidan, and later by Emma Sheen.</p>
