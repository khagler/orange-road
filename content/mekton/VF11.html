<h2>Roleplaying Notes</h2>
<p>Specs for the <a href="http://www.anime.net/macross/mecha/united_nations/variable/vf11/index.html">Thunderbolt</a> are available from Egan Loo&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.anime.net/macross/">Macross Compendium</a>.</p>
<p>The VF-11B and VF-11C have identical statistics, but for role-playing purposes keep in mind that the VF-11C has improved navigation equipment, and a slightly redesigned FAST Pack.</p>
<p>Although the Thunderbolt does have wing hardpoints, these are almost never used in practice. The wing hardpoints are apparently employed to carry heavy ordnance for strikes against fixed targets. </p>
<h3>FAST Packs</h3>
<p>The FAST Packs are actually made up of two seperate components &ndash; two booster pods that are mounted on the dorsal surface, and two conformal fuel tank/decoy dispensers that are mounted on the engines. There are standard booster pods and rarely-used atmospheric booster pods, but the fuel tank parts are the same. </p>
<p>The atmospheric FAST Packs are only available in small numbers, and are very rarely used. A Super Thunderbolt in an atmosphere can&rsquo;t exceed Mach 1 &ndash; the shock waves from the FAST pack&rsquo;s pods would cause the fighter to go out of control and crash. </p>
<p>The booster pods and fuel tanks may be jettisoned seperately or together. Although the booster pods must be jettisoned before atmospheric reentry, the fuel tanks <em>may</em> be used in an atmosphere and don&rsquo;t affect speed. </p>
<h2>Design Notes</h2>
<p>I went by the reported performance when figuring speed, since using the thrust to weight ratio produces a fighter <em>much</em> faster than the VF-11 is supposed to be. </p>
<p>Notice the FAST Pack do <em>not</em> have reentry protection. Standard FAST Packs can&rsquo;t be used in an atmosphere at all, and atmospheric FAST Packs require some form of protection such as a reentry capsule. </p>
<p>The solid rocket boosters were designed as a +50 and a +10 booster to get the right speed increase, but since they&rsquo;re actually the same size, I just split the boost in half.</p>
<p>The Radome can be used in any mode, but it doesn&rsquo;t have reentry protection. I threw this in mostly because it took very little time to design.</p>
<p>When I find the time, I&rsquo;ll post the the Full Armored Thunderbolt, which appears very briefly in Macross 7, and also Mylene&rsquo;s Custom model and the VF-11Ds used by the Jammingbirds.</p>
<p>There are also some <a href="VFNotes.html">design issues</a> common to all variable fighters.</p>
