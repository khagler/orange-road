<h2>Roleplaying Notes</h2>
<p>Specs for the <a href="http://www.anime.net/macross/mecha/united_nations/variable/vf19/index.html">Excalibur</a> are available from Egan Loo&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.anime.net/macross/">Macross Compendium</a>.</p>
<p>The VF-19s have lower speeds for use in atmosphere from ground to 10,000 meters and from 10,000 to 30,000 meters. The flight MA reflects speeds possible from 30,000 meters to space. The structure of the fighter simply can&rsquo;t stand up to any more speed in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The wing lasers may only be fired in fighter and GERWALK modes. In Battroid mode they are positioned in the &ldquo;waist&rdquo; area pointing up, and would probably hit the arms if fired.</p>
<p>There is a FAST Pack available for the Excalibur which can be used either in space or in an atmosphere. However, these are almost never used &ndash; throughout the Protodeviln War, they were only used on two occasions. </p>
<p>The conformal fuel tanks used with the FAST Pack and the fold booster are actually the same thing. Unlike the booster pods, the fuel tanks may be carried during atmospheric reentry. </p>
<p>The booster pods for a FAST Pack or fold booster render the active stealth system inoperative. As long as they are attached, the Excalibur can be detected normally. The conformal fuel tanks <em>are</em> protected by the active stealth system, however. </p>
<p>Although the Excalibur does have wing hardpoints, these are very rarely used in practice. The wing hardpoints are apparently employed to carry heavy ordnance for strikes against fixed targets. </p>
<p>The VF-19s assigned to Emerald Force are seen throughout the latter episodes of Macross 7. Emerald Force has two VF-19Fs and one VF-19S, assigned to Docker-Tai-i.</p>
<h2>Design Notes</h2>
<p>The speed for this fighter is based on its ability to fly into orbit. In <a href="http://www.best.com/%7Ertg1/mekton.html">Mekton Zeta</a>, that&rsquo;s speed 109. I then boosted it a bit so that it would be noticably faster at full throttle than a VF-11 with SRBs. This does produce a somewhat higher speed than the printed material gives it. I recommend using the lower atmospheric speeds, which match the maximum speed listed in <cite>Macross Plus: This is Animation</cite>.</p>
<p>The fold booster is capable of moving up to 40 tons. This is considerably more than is needed for a fighter, although the extra capacity does come in handy in <cite>Macross 7</cite>. </p>
<p>There are also several <a href="VFNotes.html">design issues</a> common to all variable fighters.</p>
