<h2>Roleplaying Notes</h2>
<p align="center"><img height="228" alt="VF-22S fighter mode" src="../img/vf22fighter1.gif" width="468" border="0" /> </p>
<p>Specs for the <a href="http://www.anime.net/macross/mecha/united_nations/variable/vf22/index.html">Sturmvogel</a> are available from Egan Loo&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.anime.net/macross/">Macross Compendium</a>. </p>
<p>The VF-22 has lower speeds for use in atmosphere from ground to 10,000 meters and from 10,000 to 30,000 meters. The flight MA reflects speeds possible from 30,000 meters to space. The structure of the fighter simply can&rsquo;t stand up to any more speed in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The three hardpoints are actually internal weapons bays. Each is large enough to accomodate a large missile (or presumably several smaller weapons), but any weapons carried will add to the cost of the fighter and decrease its maneuverability. </p>
<p>The only weapons seen deployed from these bays in <cite>Macross 7</cite> are long range corvette scale missiles with nuclear warheads. However, UN Spacy authorizes the use of reaction weapons only in dire emergencies. I don&rsquo;t recommend using anything that powerful. Besides, even with conventional warheads missiles that big should be able to mess up a Varauta frigate! </p>
<h2>Design Notes</h2>
<p>There are also several <a href="VFNotes.html">design issues</a> common to all variable fighters.</p>
