<h2>Roleplaying Notes</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.anime.net/macross/">Macross Compendium</a>, maintained by Egan Loo, has detailed information on the specs of the <a href="http://www.anime.net/macross/mecha/united_nations/variable/vf4/index.html">Lightning III</a>.</p>
<p>The first official drawings of a transformed VF-4 were for the recently-released Playstation game, <cite>Macross Digital Mission VF-X</cite>. The picture above was apparently scanned from advertising material for that game. Notice the picture shows a gunpod. None of the other information I&rsquo;ve found (including the game itself) indicates that VF-4s carry gunpods, so I didn&rsquo;t include one in my design. There&rsquo;s no reason a gunpod couldn&rsquo;t be picked up when needed, though.</p>
<h2>Design Notes</h2>
<p>Certain liberties were taken here, mostly with speed, since Mekton Zeta doesn&rsquo;t try to keep track of speed at various altitudes. For simplicity, I just went by the thrust/weight ratio.</p>
<p>There are certain <a href="VFNotes.html">design issues</a> common to all variable fighters.</p>
