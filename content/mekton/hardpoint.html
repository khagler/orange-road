<h1 align="center">Wing and Fuselage Hardpoints</h1>
<p>An explanation of how to handle weapon hardpoints with MTS was posted in rec.games.mecha a while back by R. Tal. That post is repeated here.</p>
<ol>
<li>Define a Hardpoint as a Weapon Mount with a Quick-Change Mount (i.e., for 2 Spaces and 3CP you can carry an interchangeable load of as many spaces as the spaces of the servo that the Hardpoint is fitted to).
</li>
<li>Design your Mecha with Hardpoints, but don&rsquo;t fill them.
</li>
<li>Calculate your Mecha&rsquo;s weight, MAs and MV.
</li>
<li>Build whatever equipment you like, as long as it can fit into the Hardpoints (efficiency time).
</li>
<li>Equip your Mecha with whatever load of mixed Hardpoint equipment you like; to determine the effects of that load, add up all kills of all Hardpoint equipment and divide by 20 &ndash; the result is the B-Mod of the hardpoint equipment load (see Z+ p.64 for a definition of B-Mod).
</li>
</ol>
