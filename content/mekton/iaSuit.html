<h2>Roleplaying Notes</h2>
<p>This is the battlesuit that appears at the very beginning of Macross Plus. This design is more opinion than anything, since no concrete information is available on this mecha. Even the identity of its owners is unclear. The <cite>Macross Plus This Is Animation</cite> book calls it <dfn>Teki no Batorusuutsu</dfn> &ndash; or, &ldquo;Enemy Battlesuit.&rdquo; Not exactly informative.</p>
<p>For my own use in a campaign I&rsquo;m working on, I&rsquo;ve chosen to call this the Inspection Army&rsquo;s version of a Queadlunn Rau (Miria&rsquo;s battlesuit from the original series). Who <em>really</em> uses it is anyone&rsquo;s guess, but one thing is fairly clear from the design &ndash; it is <em>some</em> sort of Queadlunn Rau variation.</p>
<p>An alternate interpretation is provided by Dave Dietrich in his <a href="http://www.steelfalcon.com/macrossmecha.html">Macross Mecha Page</a>. His theory is that the suit is of unknown origin, and is being supplied to various renegades and pirates who have reason to fight the UN Spacy. He also theorizes that the suit is derived from the Zentradi Nousjadel-Ger (male power armor).</p>
<h2>Design Notes</h2>
<p>The original design goal was to make this roughly comparable in combat effectiveness to the VF-11. The original design I&rsquo;d playtested enough to be satisfied with the result. However, the original VF-11 design had an autofire gunpod, and there&rsquo;s no autofire in Mekton Zeta. I haven&rsquo;t yet had time to test the new versions to see if this upsets the balance too much.</p>
