<h2>Roleplaying Notes</h2>
<p>Specs for the <a href="http://www.anime.net/macross/mecha/zentradi/AerospaceCraft/Regult.html">Regult</a> are available from Egan Loo&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.anime.net/macross/">Macross Compendium</a>.</p>
<p>The Regult is the basic Zentradi combat unit. There are missile carrier and scout variants, but this version is the most common Zentradi mecha. Since the Regult has been in production for almost 300,000 years, there are quite a few of them around.</p>
<p>A single Regult pod is not especially effective, and would be hopelessly outclassed by any variable fighter. They rely on numbers to be effective – while a UN Spacy carrier might have two or three hundred variable fighters at most, any Zentradi warship will have thousands of Regults.</p>
<h2>Design Notes</h2>
<p>Since Zentradi are “Mekton scale” themselves, I used the roadstriker scale rules for cockpits – ten spaces are set aside for a Zentradi pilot with up to body type 10.</p>
<p>This design trades four kills for eight spaces in the torso and uses the weight inefficiency to get the weight and durability to come out right. Credit for this approach goes to William R. Hutton.</p>
